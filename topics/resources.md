### Pomodoro Technique for 45 minutes, with 15 minute breaks.
- To do during breaks: 
-- Listen to music and doodle
-- Journal
-- Meditate
-- Go for a short walk outside

### Digital Distractions
- Digital distractions are email and Facebook notifications and time-wasting websites, such as social media. 
- These distractions break your focus and make procrastination tempting. Therefore, they should be avoided during study time. 
- Make them take longer than 20 seconds to reach/do and add blockers to unnecessary time consuming sites.
